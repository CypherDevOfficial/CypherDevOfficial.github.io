<p>Hello, I’m Andy Park, a 12-year-old web developer who enjoys building websites and bringing ideas to life through code. Right now, I’m wrapping up my learning in HTML and working on my own projects to apply what I’ve learned. I’m excited to start learning CSS and JavaScript, which will allow me to add more style, interactivity, and functionality to my websites. My goal is to create well-designed, user-friendly projects that not only look great but also work smoothly.
</p>
<p>One of the things I enjoy most about web development is the creativity it offers. Whether it’s using JavaScript to add interactivity or CSS to style a page, I love seeing how a few lines of code can completely transform a website. Coding is always exciting to me, and I’m eager to explore even more possibilities as I continue learning. While I’m currently focused on front-end development, I’m also interested in back-end coding. Once I’ve mastered front-end technologies, I’d love to dive into Python or other back-end languages to build more complex and dynamic projects.
</p>
<p>I'm always excited to learn new things, tackle challenges, and improve my skills with each project I create. As I continue building websites, I look forward to pushing my limits, experimenting with new ideas, and sharing even more exciting projects along the way.
</p>
